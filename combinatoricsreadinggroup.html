    <h1>Drexel Combinatorics Reading Group</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This is a small reading group focused on covering topics, basic and advanced, in algebraic combinatorics. 
      Anyone is welcome to drop by, both graduate and undergraduate students (and faculty!?).
    </p>
    <p>
      How this page looks belies how informal this is.
      In theory, Peter Mao and I run this.
      However, the words "run" and "and" are not well-defined.
    </p>
    <h2>Winter 2025</h2>
    <p>
      We meet every Friday from 4-5PM at Korman 245.
      Tentatively, we will be covering something from <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~rstan/ec/">Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics vol. 1</a> every week. 
    </p>

      (Also, there is an algebraic geometry group and category theory group that meets in the same room on Wednesdays 4PM and Thursdays 2PM respectively)
